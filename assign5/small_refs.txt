disk space = block size * # of blocks

rotational time: p(rpm)
average rotational delay: (1/2)*(1/p)min
block transfer time: B/tr
B = bytes tr = (size of track in bytes) / (time it takes for 1 rev)
(ex): tr = (50*1000)/(60*1000/30000) = 3000bytes/msec

transfer into block: (seek time +rd + btt)

noncontiguos blocks that may not be on the same track or cylinder
k*(seek time +rd + btt) msec
noncontiguos blocks that are on the same track or cylinder
s + (k*(rd+btt))
k is contingious
s+rd+(k*btt)msec
